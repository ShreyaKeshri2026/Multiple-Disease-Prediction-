 Multiple Disease Prediction System
📌 Project Overview
This project is a Multiple Disease Prediction System that uses Machine Learning models to predict the presence of diseases like Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson’s Disease based on user-inputted medical information. The goal is to assist early detection and raise awareness.

💡 Features
🔍 Predicts Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson's Disease

🧪 Trained on real medical datasets

🧠 Uses ML algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM

🖥️ User-friendly interface using Streamlit or Flask

📊 Instant and accurate results based on health metrics

🧱 Tech Stack
Languages: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Streamlit/Flask

ML Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn (optional)
